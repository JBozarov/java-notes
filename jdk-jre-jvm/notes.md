3. Importance of Programming
4. What programming means
5. Different programming languages
6. What is Java
   1. What is Java technology and why do I need it?
      Java is a widely-used programming language for coding web applications. It has been a popular choice among developers for over two decades, with millions of Java applications in use today. 
   2. Java is a multi-platform, object-oriented, and network-centric language that can be used as a platform in itself. It is a fast, secure, reliable programming language for coding everything from mobile apps and enterprise software to big data applications and server-side technologies.

8. Java history
   1. Jdk and different versions
       You wrote your abc.java code ( classes )
       You click Run and it invokes the Java Compiler. Compiler checks the syntax error, if not error it converts the .java files into intermediate code( abc.class file) known as bytecode. This intermediate code is platform independent (you can take this bytecode from a machine running windows and use it in any other machine running Linux or MacOS etc). Also this bytecode is an intermediate code, hence it is only understandable by the JVM and not the user or even the hardware /OS layer.
       Class loader loads the bytecode into a JVM
       Now JIT ( part of JVM ) runs the bytecode ( .class files )

9. Code editors and IDEs
10. Intellij and installation
11. Create projects
